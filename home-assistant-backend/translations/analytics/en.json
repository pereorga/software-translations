This data will only ever include device-specific details (like model or manufacturer) \u2013 never personally identifying information (like the names you assign).\n\nFind out how we process your data (should you choose to contribute) in our [Data Use Statement](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/device-database-data-use-statement).",
