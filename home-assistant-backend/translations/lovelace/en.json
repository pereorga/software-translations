Your YAML dashboards will continue to work, you just need to update how they are defined.\n\nTo update your configuration:\n\n1. Remove `mode: yaml` from `lovelace:` in your `configuration.yaml`\n2. Add a dashboard entry instead:\n\n   ```yaml\n   lovelace:\n     resource_mode: yaml\n     dashboards:\n       lovelace:\n         mode: yaml\n         filename: {config_file}\n         title: Overview\n         icon: mdi:view-dashboard\n         show_in_sidebar: true\n   ```\n\n3. Restart Home Assistant\n\nNote: `resource_mode: yaml` keeps loading resources from YAML. If you want to manage resources through the UI instead, you can remove this line and move your resources to Settings > Dashboards > Resources.",
